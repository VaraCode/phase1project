                <p>Dorothea Lange is considered to be one of the most influential American photographers.  During The Great Depression, Lange worked for <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/bios/dorothea-lange/">the Farm Security Administration (FSA).</a>  Her extensive collection of photographs for the FSA bear witness to the struggles of everyday people trying to survive the greatest economic crisis the country ever experienced.   </p>
                <p>She was born on <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/dorothea-lange-9372993#early-years"> May 26, 1895, in Hoboken, New Jersey.</a> As a child, Lange experienced two major traumatic events: she contracted polio and her father abandoned the family.  Despite the disease leaving Lange with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lange">a limp for the rest of her life,</a> she credited it with shaping the person she became:</p>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.biography.com/people/dorothea-lange-9372993#early-years">
                    <em>[It] was the most important thing that happened to me, and formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me...</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Lange <a href="http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/SpringSummer2010/Pages/DorotheaLangeEsophagealCancer.aspx?Page=2">added:</a></p>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/SpringSummer2010/Pages/DorotheaLangeEsophagealCancer.aspx?Page=2">
                    <em>I've never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and the power of it.</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Perhaps her early difficulties gave Lange a keen awareness and empathy for other people's suffering.</p>

                <p>Above Photo: <cite> "Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age thirty-two. Nipomo, California" </cite> by Dorothea Lange, 1936. <span style="font-style: italic">The New York Public Library Digital Collections.</span></p>
                <p>In her most iconic photograph, popularly known as <em>Migrant Mother</em> (above), Lange captures the desperation and concern of a migrant farmer mother trying to sustain her family.   According to the book, <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0lAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=dorothea+lange&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimwZ225JvOAhUIbR4KHdEwBzMQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=dorothea%20lange&f=false">Dorothea Lange: Grab a Hunk of Lightning,</a> </em> the photograph almost didn't happen.</p>
                <p>In 1936, while on assignment, Lange drove past a sign, "Pea Picker's Camp" in Nipomo, California.  Having photographed the subject of migrant farmers before, she wondered if it wasn't <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0lAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=dorothea%20lange&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=dorothea%20lange&f=false"> "just more of the same."</a></p>
                <p>Inexplicably, Lange drove back towards the sign and the camp. There, she encountered a woman:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0lAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=dorothea%20lange&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=dorothea%20lange&f=false">
                    <em>huddled under a torn canvas tent with her children.  The family had been living on frozen vegetables they'd gleaned from the fields and birds the children killed.</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The photograph was published days later in the <em>San Francisco News</em>.  Public awareness led to the federal government providing <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0lAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=dorothea%20lange&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=dorothea%20lange&f=false"> "twenty thousand pounds of food to migrants."</a></p>
