                <p>On October 29, 1929, a day known as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/rails-timeline/">  "Black Tuesday"</a> the American stock market collapsed.  Less than a month later, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/rails-timeline/"> an estimated $30 billion in stock values disappeared.</a>  The Great Depression was born.  For a decade, it held both the country and the world hostage.  </p>
                <p>In the United States, unemployment was widespread, peaking at <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/american-enterprise-exhibition/corporate-era/great-depression"> 25% in 1933</a>.  For most of the Depression, unemployment remained at <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/american-enterprise-exhibition/corporate-era/great-depression"> 15% of the labor force.</a></p>
                <p>Along with the decline in stock values, came the progressive collapse of the banking system.  <a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/depression/about.htm"> By "1933, 11,000 of the United States' 25,000 banks had failed."</a>   </p>
                <p>A contributing factor for the banking panics were the significant farm debts incurred throughout the 1920s by farmers.  World War I had led to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression/Causes-of-the-decline">"high prices"</a> for agricultural goods and American farmers took loans in order to <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression/Causes-of-the-decline"> "increase production by investing in land and machinery."</a>  </p>
                <p>With depressed demand and prices, farmers could not make payments and keep their farms.  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-GQdY7ACvgC&lpg=PA12&dq=farmers%20great%20depression&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q=farmers%20great%20depression&f=false">"By 1933 lenders were repossessing twenty thousand farms each month."</a></p>

                <p>When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, he implemented the mandate of the <a href="http://academic.mu.edu/meissnerd/depression.htm">New Deal</a> - a series of public programs aimed at increasing employment.</p>
                <p>One of the many programs of the New Deal was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration"> Farmers Security Administration (FSA)</a>.  Dorothea Lange, and other photographers were hired to document the plight of the rural poor:</p>
                <blockquote cite="http://depts.washington.edu/depress/dorothea_lange_photography_depression.shtml">
                    <em> <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/depress/dorothea_lange_photography_depression.shtml">"FSA photographs served as a political tool, for they helped the nation see the effects of the Depression on an individual level and challenged the agricultural practices and policies of the time." </a> </em>
