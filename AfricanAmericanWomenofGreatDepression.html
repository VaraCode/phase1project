                <p>The Great Depression further illustrated the divide between African-Americans and White Americans.</p>
                <p>In 1929, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_depression.html">"two thirds of some two million black farmers earned nothing or went into debt."</a> </p>
                <p>Violence stemming from segregation and discrimination, especially in the South, kept African-American men unemployed as white, unemployed men sought jobs such as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_depression.html">"busboys, elevator operators, garbage men, porters... and cooks"</a>  which were traditionally associated with African-Americans. </p>
                <p>African-American women fared just as poorly:</p>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/great-depression/essays/women-and-great-depression">
                    <em> <a href="http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/great-depression/essays/women-and-great-depression">"In 1930 nine out of ten African American women worked in agriculture or domestic service, both areas hard hit by the depression. Housewives who previously hired servants began to do their own housework; sometimes white women competed for jobs previously abandoned as too undesirable to black women."</a> </em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Unemployment was so severe among African-American women, that <a href="https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/industry/12.htm">"in 1935, 25% of black women were receiving government relief payments."</a></p>

                <p> Although President Roosevelt's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal"> New Deal</a> public programs were meant to reduce unemployment, they still could not overcome racism and segregation: </p>
                <blockquote cite="http://millercenter.org/president/biography/fdroosevelt-the-american-franchise">
                    <em> <a href="http://millercenter.org/president/biography/fdroosevelt-the-american-franchise">"Racism reared its head in the New Deal, often because federal programs were administered through local authorities or community leaders who brought their own racial biases to the table. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) offered white landowners cash for leaving their fields fallow, which they happily accepted; they, however, did not pass on their government checks to the black sharecroppers and tenant farmers who actually worked the land.
